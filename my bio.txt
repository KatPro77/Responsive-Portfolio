After graduating from the Technical School of Mechanical ENgineering in the Czech republic I have decided to get a priceless continuing education from the world renowned University of Write your own story. 

I left CZ adn moved to London where I spent 3 years observing, studying and learning the English language. Graduating from (CABE) the Cockney Academy of Bad English which provided me with the necessary communication skills whaich I decided to put to the test by working on additional degrees around the World. My Bachelor's was worked on at the Safari International School in East Africa with majors in Photoraphy and Interpersonal International Human Studies. Travelling through Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa allowed me to master the amazing language of Arms and Legs and properly communicate and explore local culture.In fall of 1999 I travelled to Australia for my Gap Year where I expanded my horizons on many levels by networking wit travellers from oter parts of the world. 

Upon my return to Europe where I stayed fro 6 months, I decided that it was time to hit the road again and in February 2001 I landed in Charlotte. By accident I may add and was only planning on staying for one year. Did not really worked out that way. I worked my way up through multiple restaurant jobs until about 6 years ago when I got the opportunity to work for a company with great values, ethics and people that care about their employees. Because of all those qualities I made a decision to make the U.S. my permanent home and in 2016 I became a citizen. I also believe the tit is extremely important to give back and my community involvment includes work with Susan G. Komen Foundation, Pilots & Paws, Sustain Charlotte and the U.S. Green Building Council.
